How to install or upgrade
=========================

The easiest way to install this plugin is by using the Plugins Admin.
From the "Plugins" menu, choose the "Plugins Admin".
Search for "Snippets" plugin, choose "install" and follow the instructions on the screen.

To manually install the plugin, copy all the files in archive to the ``plugins/NppSnippets`` directory
in the Notepad++ installation directory typically in the ``Program Files`` directory.
You may need to create that directory.
Then (re)start Notepad++.

When you automatically upgrade through the Plugin Admin your database
is not touched. If you are manually upgrading at least replace the
existing dll. It is up to you if you override your own database with the
template database provided in the archive. If you have not changed
existing snippets or added your own, it is recommended to use the
database in the archive.
